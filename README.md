## Challenges
#1. Git Management was an initial challenge for the team. Specifially around breaking up tasks and only coding for those specific tasks before pushing to master. TA - Leif Hetland helped us initially navigate how to appropriate troubleshoot and fix our Branch merge conflicts.

#2. We moved a little too fast initially formatting the CSS styling and HTML prior to having working script. This required us to go back to a simpler HTML and CSS format on 9-20-2020, in order to connect working JavaScript for our Job Results cards to work.

#3. Formatting our API call so that it returned and dynamically populated the right information was also a significant challenge as well.


## Successes
Overall, this was truly a team effort and everyone contributed solidly.

#Despite working with and around colds, injuries, children's birthdays, and other life related issues - we managed to keep moving the ball forward.

I give a huge credit to everyone for their positive team energy, willingness to share the load, open communication, and professional attitude throughout the project.
